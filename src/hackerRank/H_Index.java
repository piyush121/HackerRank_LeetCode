 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a
 * researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * 
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h
 * if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h
 * papers have no more than h citations each."
 * 
 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher
 * has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations
 * respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations
 * each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is
 * 3.
 * 
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as
 * the h-index.
